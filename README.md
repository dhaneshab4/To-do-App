# To-do-App
 A Django-based web app for task management, allowing users to add, edit, and delete to-do items. Features include user authentication, task filtering by priority, and due date setting. Built with a responsive interface for an efficient and seamless user experience.

# **Users should be able to:**

* View an optimal layout for the app on different device screens
* Add, mark as complete, and delete tasks
* Filter tasks by all/active/completed
* Clear all completed tasks

# Built with:

* **Django** – Web framework for backend logic.
* **HTML/CSS** – Structure and styling for the front-end.

# Structuring Django Project with Apps:

* Learned how to organize code into modular components by creating a dedicated app (base) for managing tasks. Each part of the app is separated into files like views.py, models.py, urls.py, etc., ensuring a clean architecture.

*  Gained experience in customizing Django's admin panel for better management of models. Configured task models to be editable and visible, making administration easier.

*  Mastered creating forms using Django's forms module for handling user inputs, such as adding, updating, and deleting tasks from the to-do list. This involved validating user input and rendering form fields dynamically in templates.

*  Implemented task-related functionalities using Django ORM. Learned how to define models and work with database migrations to store and manipulate data efficiently, like managing task statuses (active, complete).

*  Created unit tests to ensure the functionality of different views, such as task creation and deletion, is working as expected. Writing tests improved my confidence in the stability of the app and ensured no regressions during future updates.

*  Understood how to map views to URLs within the urls.py file. This enabled users to navigate different parts of the app, like accessing the home page (task list), adding tasks, or logging in/out. Dynamic URLs were also created to handle task-specific actions (edit, delete).

*  Gained hands-on experience writing Django views for handling CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks. Leveraged Django's class-based views and function-based views to efficiently display, update, and delete tasks, improving the overall user experience.
